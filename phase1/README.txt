Setup Instructions:
1. Install Android Studio module in IntelliJ
2. Import the project from Git
3. Open new project with CalendarApp as root in IntelliJ
4. Enable Gradle build and wait for about a minute
5. Open AVD Manager and Create Virtual Device phone with API 26 (Pixel 3 Oreo)


Notes:

Please use the Android UI to test project.

View Alerts, Memos and Events button outputs to System.out.

Due to one of our teammate's family emergency, we were unable to implement create recurring events and create events by frequency through UI. Also, we were unable to implement attaching memos or alerts to an event through UI. However, these methods have been implemented in our Java classes.
